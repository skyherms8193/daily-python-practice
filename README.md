# Daily Python Practice

This repository documents my ongoing Python practice as I build technical depth and strengthen problem-solving skills.

## Goals
- Practice writing clean, readable functions
- Improve logical thinking and edge-case handling
- Reinforce core Python fundamentals
- Build consistency through daily work

Problems are organized by week to track progression.
